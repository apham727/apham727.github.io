This project was developed during my first hackathon as a freshman at Rice University. The app was created using the Python-Flask framework. It's purpose was to classify images using IBM watson to determine if the primary object in that image was recycleable. 

We empirically developed a attribute weighting system that would lead to the highest accuracy in image classification.

## CS Interests
I'm interested in cloud computing and its applications because the idea of scalability seems pretty neat to me.

I'm also taking classes in machine learning and would always like to learn and gain more experience with it. 

## Personal Interests
I love coupes, 20th century history, and almost anything on Wikipedia.

I'm also a huge signal processing fan - we have a super awesome electrical engineering faculty at Rice and this subject has some really interesting applications of math.
